**1) Capastone Project**
(Advanced CNN and Sequential NLP)

create a solution for this problem by auto-generating these clinical diagnostic reports by applying the convolutional layers and sequence-to-sequence NLP modeling concepts. The model learns from the historical MRI images of the Lumbar Spine along with their corresponding clinical notes for 510 patients 

**Skills and Tools**:
Advanced Computer Vision, cheXnet Model, encoder-decoder model, Pubmed Word embedding , Attention layer.


**2) Face detection**:
(Computer Vision)

Face recognition deals with Computer Vision a discipline of Artificial Intelligence and uses techniques of image processing and deep learning. The objective of this project is to build a face recognition system, which includes building a face detector to locate the position of a face in an image and a face identification model to recognize whose face it is by matching it to the existing database of faces.

**Skills and Tools**:
Computer Vision, Keras, SiameseNetworks, Triplet Loss


**3)Fake News detection**
(Sequence Models in NLP)

The goal of Fake News detection is not to directly identify whether a headline or article is “fake” or not, which is arguably a highly subjective question, and one that even skilled humans may have difficulty answering. The objective is around the well-defined problem of “stance detection,” which involves comparing a headline with a body of text from a news article to determine what relationship (if any) exists between the two.

**Skills and Tools:**
RNN, Word embedding, LSTM, Attention models


**4)Predicting author features using a NLP classifier**
(Statistical NLP)

The project involves building an NLP classifier that predicts multiple features of the author of a given text. This is a Multi-label classification problem that can predict the label/s of the blog based on a given input text. And build a semi-rule based interactive chatbot.

**Skills and Tools:**
multilabel classification, natural language processing, Chatbot


**5)German Traffic Sign Recognition**
(Computer Vision with CNNs)

The German Traffic Sign Benchmark is a multi-class, single-image classification challenge held at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2011. They cordially invite researchers from relevant fields to participate: The competition is designed to allow for participation without special domain knowledge. Their benchmark has the following properties: - Single-image, multi-class classification problem - More than 40 classes - More than 50,000 images in total - Large, lifeli

**Skills and Tools:**
CNN, Computer Vision, Classification


**6)Implementing a Image classification neural network to classify Street House View Numbers**
(Neural Networks & Deep Learning)

SVHN is a real-world image dataset for developing object recognition algorithms with a requirement on data formatting but comes from a significantly harder, unsolved, real-world problem (recognizing digits and numbers in natural scene images). SVHN is obtained from house numbers in Google Street View images. The objective of the project is to learn how to implement a simple image classification pipeline based on the k-Nearest Neighbor and a deep neural network.

**Skills and Tools:**
Neural Networks, Deep Learning, Keras, Image Recognition


**7)Product Recommendation Systems**
(Recommendation Systems)

This project involved building recommendation systems for Amazon products. A popularity-based model and a collaborative Filtering model were used and evaluated to recommend top-10 products for a user.

**Skills and Tools:**
Collaborative Filtering, Recommender Systems, Python


**8)Predict the Bankruptcy with Unsupervised Learning Techniques**
(Unsupervised Learning)

This data-set contains various qualitative parameters from experts which can help predict the bankruptcy.You learn skills in exploratory data analysis, data visualization, clustering and Principal component analysis

**Skills and Tools:**
PCA, Clustering, Data Visualization


**9)Diagnosing Parkinson's disease using Random Forests** `
(Ensemble Techniques)

This Project involved using classification algorithms and ensemble techniques to diagnose Parkinson’s Disease (PD) using the patient voice recording data. Various models were used including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest etc. and comparison of accuracy across these models was done to finalize the model for prediction

**Skills and Tools:**
EDA, Logistic regression, Decision Trees


**10)Identifying potential customers for loans**
(Supervised Learning)

Identified potential loan customers for Thera Bank using classification techniques. Compared models built with Logistic Regression and KNN algorithm in order to select the best performing one.

**Skills and Tools:**
Logistic Regression, KNN, Classification


**11)Analyzed health information to make decisions for insurance business**
(Statistical Learning)

This project used Hypothesis Testing and Visualization to leverage customer's health information like smoking habits, BMI, age, and gender for checking statistical evidence to make valuable decisions of insurance business like charges for health insurance.

**Skills and Tools:**
Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, Statistical Inference
